# New Retail Customer Segmentation Dashboard
# Situation
The New Retail Customer Segmentation Dashboard  project involves analyzing a dataset that was collected from kaggle website containing customer transactions to gain insights into customer behavior , preferences and Market Research Analysis. The dataset includes various attributes such as transaction details, customer demographics, purchase patterns, product information, and feedback. The goal is to segment customers effectively and create a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI that visually represents these segments and key metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making for improving marketing strategies, customer engagement, and overall business performance.
# Task
As the Data And Business Analyst on this project, I was responsible for designing and implementing a dashboard that would allow users to explore key metrics related to the customer segmentation. I worked personally by putting more effort to this project  to identify the most relevant data sources and key metrics to track and analyse this data. I then used PowerBi, one of the most popular and powerful data visualization tools, to create an interactive dashboard that would allow users to explore the data and gain insights.
# Action
The action plan for the  project involves several key steps. First,I clean and preprocess the dataset to handle any missing ,duplicates or inconsistent data. Next, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify significant patterns. Use statistical techniques and clustering algorithms to segment customers based on various attributes such as demographics, purchase behavior, and feedback. Then, design and develop a dynamic dashboard in Power BI, incorporating visualizations like charts, graphs, and maps to represent customer segments and key metrics effectively. Finally, validate the dashboard  and refine it to ensure it meets business needs and supports strategic decision-making.The preview of the dashboard is available below.

# Result
The dashboard has been a tremendous success, providing valuable insights into the progress of customer segmentation program.
Some of the quantifiable results of the project include:
- Regular customers is among the customer segment with the most high income contribution and slightly New customers, but premium customers contributes to the lowest.
- Medium and Low customers are among the income segment that contributes to high income contributions compared to high income customers.
- USA is the leading Country with highest revenue contributions followed by UK and GERMANY with slightly constant revenue contribution and CANADA ,AUSTRALIA with lowest revenue.
- Electronics and Grocery are among the product type that contributes to the highest income revenue compared to Clothing,Home Decor and Books.
- Credit Card and Debit Card are among the payment type that appears to be more popular used than Cash and Paypal.
# Recommendations
- Focusing marketing and loyalty programs on Regular customers, as they are the highest income contributors. Considering personalized offers and premium services to enhance their engagement. Developing targeted outreach campaigns to understand the needs and preferences of new and premium customers and tailor offerings accordingly.
- Developing strategies to maintain and increase contributions from Medium and Low-income segments, as they collectively contribute significantly to revenue. Tailored promotions and budget-friendly options could be effective. Introducing flexible payment plans and financing options to make higher-value products accessible to these segments.On the other hand we need to focus on promotions and campaigns and understand their needs to  high icome segments to take advantage of their segment.
- Creating localized promotions and marketing campaigns tailored to the preferences of customers in USA ,UK and GERMANY countries to boost sales.Also Ensuring a broad range of products is available in these markets to meet diverse customer needs and preferences. Conducting thorough market research in Canada And Australia to identify the reasons behind lower revenue contributions and adjust strategies accordingly.Also Forming partnerships with local businesses to increase brand visibility and reach in these countries.
- Investing in the innovation of electronics and grocery products to maintain interest and encourage repeat purchases. Creating attractive bundle offers combining electronics and grocery items to increase average transaction value. Gathering customer feedback to understand why Clothing, Home Decor, and Books  are less popular products and identify areas for improvement.
-  Highlighting the security and convenience of using credit and debit cards in marketing materials to encourage continued use. Offering incentives such as discounts or reward points for customers who use credit or debit cards for their purchases. Promoting the availability of various payment methods to ensure all customer preferences are accommodated such as cash and paypal.
